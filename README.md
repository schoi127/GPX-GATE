# Ground-penetrating X-ray simulation using GATE

This project is a software developed by the Intelligent Component Sensor Research Lab for simulating ground-penetrating backscatter X-rays (GPX) using the GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission) toolkit, which is based on Geant4 particle simulations. The main features and functionalities are as follows:

## Usage 
- Perform the steps in order.
- Step 1) Electron to Fan-beam X-ray phase space
- Step 2) GPX system run session #1: Simulation of backscatter X-rays with/without collimator
- Step 3) GPX system run session #2: Backscatter X-ray simulation for different materials at varying depths with fixed soil density
- Step 4) GPX system run session #3: Backscatter X-ray simulation for different materials at varying soil densities with fixed depth
- Step 5) GPX system run session #4: Calculation of backscatter rate for different materials based on X-ray incident energy at 0cm surface with fixed soil density
